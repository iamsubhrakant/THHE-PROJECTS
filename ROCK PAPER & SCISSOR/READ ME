🎮 Just wrapped up my latest project and I'm ecstatic to share it with my LinkedIn fam! 🚀 Introducing my rendition of the timeless classic: ROCK, PAPER & SCISSORS!

🛠️ Here's the breakdown:

- Crafted the frontend using HTML & CSS for that sleek look

- Implemented dynamic gameplay with JavaScript, diving into events, functions, and logic

- Created an engaging user experience with automated prompts for player input

- Challenged myself by developing an AI opponent that generates random options using arrays/indexes

- Added a touch of finesse with automatic score updates, keeping the competition fierce!

💡 Overcoming some hurdles, especially fine-tuning the logic, was all part of the journey. But the satisfaction of a bug-free project? Priceless!
