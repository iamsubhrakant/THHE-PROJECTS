I created a website for Biswal Infotech Solutions (BITS) using HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design. The site showcases BITS' services, portfolio, and company information with intuitive navigation and visually appealing elements. By leveraging the latest web standards, I optimized the website for performance and cross-browser compatibility, providing a seamless experience for users across various devices.
